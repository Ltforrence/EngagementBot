# EngagementBot
LOL looks like I left up my real keys by mistake! someone tweeted with this thing. I was very dumb thought I had changed them since I posted this stuff!!!!!! well now the keys you see won't work for sure


Looking to add sql or other database backing soon! That is my next big goal here really


Also, if you were looking at this and did that tweet, let me know! I feel stupid and want to know about it


This is a twitter bot made using the python library Tweepy that will give my account some more engagement as a bit.

I have some private docs on my local machine that I will upload to show my progress and stuff, but heres some general information

All of the keys in test files are outdated. But useful to see because sometimes the name of a key from twitter is different and the format helps for identification.

This is my first twitter bot. I am making it because I am bored and want to explore what is possible with the twitter API and I really want my tweets to get more likes.


The plan:
Have the bot follow anyone who follows it back
Have the bot like all tweets the accounts it follows tweets
If you send it a DM, it will reply to all of your tweets as well with a custom message. "Great tweet _____" with the blank being whatever you dmed it
I would like this to be running constantly (or like at least once a minute)
Also I think with the DM functionality I could code in a few keywords that whenever I DM the bot it will do even more things



You will not be able to use this bot unless you change the keys in the config file
