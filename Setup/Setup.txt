### Setup Doc
I would just like to have this here to allow an easier flow of info here. I have a lot of different folders in my github that are likely confusing



If you are setting up your own Twitter bot this readme should help you out once I am done the project fully it should be nicely formatted and explanative


Because I have been posting all this online I use Environment variables (os.getenv calls). This is probably not the best way to do stuff, but I like it.
Obviously you can hardcode these value, but if you also want to add them the same way I did, use $Env:VARIABLE_NAME="value" in powershell to set these.
I am currently editing all the code and will update this readme as I see fit! 
Also, there will probably be some code I have in these that isn't referenced in the readmes because I did a lot of unnecessary testing and messing around


### Database Setup
1. Download MySQL and MySQL toolbench
2. Create a root user and accompanying password
3. Add ROOT_PASSWORD as an environment variable in powershell
3. Run the create_database.py file in Tests (Or just create by any means) then run the accompanying test file to see that it worked or check SQL Workbench
4. Run the create_tables.py file in Tests, then run the accompanying test file to see if they were created successfully.
	a. There should be some test data bootstrapped in so you can run queries in workbench or through python files
5. Ahhh This is it I think!!! May edit this later after I replicate this somewhere else!



### Environment Setup
Eventually this will be hosted on AWS or Azure so I will include notes on how to do that here! Also will include some install notes here for desktop usage if I feel like it!

Note: my requirements.txt does not contain all of the requirements yet. I am sure of that, but will update it at the end because I am not sure what I'm missing and just don't feel like doing all that now.
